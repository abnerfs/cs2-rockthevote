# Configs
- A config file will be created in `addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/plugins/RockTheVote` the first time you load the plugin.
- Changes in the config file will require you to reload the plugin or restart the server (change the map won't work).
- Maps that will be used in RTV/nominate/votemap/end of map vote are located in addons/counterstrikesharp/configs/plugins/RockTheVote/maplist.txt
- 
## RockTheVote
Players can type rtv to request the map to be changed, once a number of votes is reached (by default 60% of players in the server) a vote will start for the next map, this vote lasts up to 30 seconds (hardcoded for now), in the end server changes to the winner map.

# Limitations
 - Plugins is still under development and a lot of functionality is still going to be added in the future.
 - I usually test the new versions in an empty server with bots so it is hard to tell if everything is actually working, feel free to post any issues here or in the discord thread so I can fix them https://discord.com/channels/1160907911501991946/1176224458751627514
